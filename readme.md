# 🫀 Heart Simulation Algorithms  

A **work-in-progress** repository aimed at simulating human heart functions using Python. This project will model heartbeats, ECG waveforms, blood flow dynamics, and adaptive responses to oxygen levels and stress. Future enhancements may include AI-driven diagnostics and web-based visualization.  

## 🚧 Current Status: Work in Progress  
This project is still under development. Stay tuned for updates!  

## 📌 Planned Features  
✔ **Heartbeat Simulation** – Generate synthetic heartbeats using statistical models.  
✔ **ECG Waveform Generation** – Simulate realistic P-QRS-T waveforms with variations.  
✔ **Blood Flow & Pressure Model** – Calculate cardiac output, stroke volume, and BP fluctuations.  
✔ **Valve Mechanics** – Model heart valve states and timing based on pressure changes.  
✔ **Oxygenation & Stress Response** – Introduce adaptive HR & BP changes based on external conditions.  
✔ **Arrhythmia Simulation** – Implement random anomalies like AFib and bradycardia.  
✔ **Real-Time Visualization** – Graph heart metrics dynamically using Matplotlib/Dash.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Dash (for UI), Pandas (for logging)  

## 📅 Development Roadmap
